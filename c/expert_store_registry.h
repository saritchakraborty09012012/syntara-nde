/*
 * Pluggable expert-store backend registry.
 *
 * The DeepSeek-V4 engine opens its expert store through a backend selected by
 * the SYNTARA_EXPERT_STORE environment variable (default "auto" = the built-in
 * on-disk/mmap store). A backend registers a name + an open function matching
 * SyntaraExpertStoreBackendOpenFn. Backends ship as separate object files and
 * register themselves at link time via a C constructor, so the engine source
 * carries no backend-specific branching — adding a backend (e.g. a networked
 * store) is a link-time concern, not an engine edit.
 *
 * The built-in "auto" backend (syntara_v4_expert_store_open_planned) is registered
 * by this module's own constructor, so with SYNTARA_EXPERT_STORE unset the engine
 * behaves exactly as before this seam existed.
